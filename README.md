# getLexicographicallyNextValue

Please write the below program in a language of your choice.

Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers o the 
lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers. 
If such the arrangement is not possible, it must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 → 1,3,2

3,2,1 → 1,2,3

1, 1, 5 → 1, 5, 1
